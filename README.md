# Example of Eastlayer's Smart Index (Coin using OP_RETURN)

Using the Smart Index, anyone has the ability to create their own metaprotocol and have it indexed in a decentralized manner. This means that developers can design and implement unique protocols that suit their specific needs, and these protocols will be indexed without relying on a central authority.

This project is an example of Smart Index that implements a simplified coin metaprotocol. You can find the Smart Index code on `smartindex/` and the script to execute transaction on bitcoin on `script/`.
